# Smart-Farming-System-Uisng-ML-Algorithms

The objective of the project is to develop and implement a smart farming system utilizing 
machine learning technologies to optimize agricultural practices and enhance the profitability 
and sustainability of farming operations. collecting and integrating diverse agricultural data 
sources, including soil characteristics, weather patterns, and crop types, to provide a 
comprehensive understanding of the farming environment. Developing predictive models using 
machine learning algorithms to forecast critical parameters such as crop yields, disease 
outbreaks, and weather conditions with high accuracy. Reduce resource waste by optimizing 
application based on specific needs of the crops and environmental conditions. By achieving 
these objectives, the project aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of smart farming 
powered by machine learning, ultimately contributing to the advancement of sustainable and 
resilient agricultural practices.

This project focuses on using machine learning (ML) to improve crop yield prediction 
and resource management in smart farming. The project aims to address challenges like resource 
scarcity, climate change, and increasing demand for food by improving agricultural efficiency 
and sustainability. Additionally, the project will involve designing and deploying crop 
recommendation systems to suggest the most suitable crops for cultivation based on local 
environmental factors and market demand. The scope also includes rigorous evaluation and 
validation of the smart farming system's performance against historical data and real-world 
scenarios, as well as deployment in collaboration with farmers and stakeholders to foster 
adoption and ensure effective utilization. the project aims to measure the tangible benefits of the 
smart farming system on crop yields, resource efficiency, and economic viability, thereby 
contributing to the advancement of sustainable and resilient agricultural practices. 

A comparative study of various machine learning can be applied on a dataset with a 
view to determine the best performing methodology. The prediction is found by applying 
the Regression Based Techniques such as Logistic, Random Forest and support vector machine. 
These machine learning algorithms are performed on the dataset containing details about the 
climatic conditions, Temperature, humidity present in the atmosphere and the ph levels. 
In this project, the model is given with the data from the environment such as the 
temperature, humidity present in the atmosphere and the ph values as the input and predicts the 
crop that is best suited for that particular weather conditions. To implement the project, a dataset 
is taken. To create the dataset, information about crops over the previous years was gathered 
from a variety of sources, such as government websites.
